# StickerFire
An application for measuring interest in your custom sticker designs.

## The Problem
Most sticker manufacturers require minimum orders for custom Stickers, usually around 250 units or so.  What are you going to do with all of these stickers? You probably don't need 250 stickers for personal use.  Do you intend to sell these stickers somewhere?  Will they sell?
If your stickers don't sell, you'll have wasted your money and 249 stickers.

StickerFire can help you avoid this conundrum.  With Stickerfire you can start a campaign to measure interest in your sticker designs BEFORE they go into production.

# How it works
## Visitors (not logged-in)
Visitors can browse sticker campaigns. They cannot vote (simulates ordering), or launch thier own campaigns.
1. Go to https://stickerfire20171113054734.azurewebsites.net/
1. Select "Browse Campaigns" from the homepage to view active campaigns.
2. Register to unlock full site functionality.

## Users(logged-in)
As a registered user, you can vote on stickers you like by clicking the "Vote!" button on individual campaign pages.
You can also launch your own campaigns.

Follow these simple steps to get your campaign launched and get users voting on your design.
1. Click the login/register link in the upper left corner of the webpage to complete a standard registration process. Only logged in users can launch a campaign and vote on other user designs.
1. You can now launch a campaign.  There are two places you can start this process: From the homepage, and from the top of your "My Campaigns" page found by navigating the "Manage" dropdown menu on the nav bar.  
1. Once you select "New Campaign" you will be taken to the campaign creation form.  Give your campaign a title, a category, and a short description.  Upload your artwork using the "Upload" button. (Use a PNG file with a transparent background for best results.)
1. Click the "Create" button once you are satisfied with your campaign.

## Congratulations! You have submitted your campaign!
Now stickerfire will automatically add a white border and cutline to your image so it looks like a real sticker.
You can view your new sticker campaign on your "My Campaigns" page. You'll notice that your new sticker is not yet published.  New campaigns are subjected to administrator approval before going live.  This helps us ensure that no innapproprate images are displayed to the public.

Once your campaign passes administrative screening it will be published and automatically go live.
Be sure to share your campaign with your target market so that users can vote on your sticker to reach the minimum goal of 25.
If nobody knows about your awesome sticker, they can't tell you if they like it or not.
Good luck!
